In this miniproject we install
- VLC
- Python-pip, which is needed for installing Livestreamer
- Livestreamer
and add a small configuration file from a template.

With Livestreamer you can watch streams (e.g from Twitch, Youtube Live) in your favourite media player.
Running the Livestreamer module installs also VLC and pip, so running all three modules is not necessary.
